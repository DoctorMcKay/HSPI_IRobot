# iRobot for HS4

This is a free, open-source HomeSeer plugin that enables monitoring and control of iRobot
robots in HS4.

# Installation

This plugin is available in the HomeSeer plugin updater.

If you'd like to install a new version early before it's approved for release in the plugin updater,
download the zip file starting with "iRobot" from the [releases page](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/HSPI_IRobot/releases).
Extract the zip, then copy these files to these locations:

- HSPI_IRobot.exe and HSPI_IRobot.exe.config go in your HS4 installation folder
- All .dll files go in bin/iRobot relative to your HS4 installation folder
- All .html and .js files go in html/iRobot relative to your HS4 installation folder
- Ignore install.txt; it's only used by the HS4 plugin updater
